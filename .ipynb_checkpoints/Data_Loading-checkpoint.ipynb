       "\"-Week 18 aboard the Depth Reaver , Circa 2023- <newline> <newline> I walk about the dull gray halls , the artificial gravity making my steps feel almost as if they were on land . Almost . I glance out a window as I pass it by . There 's the sun , and there 's the moon right there . And , of course , there 's the Earth . I kinda miss it . Then again , space is pretty cool . It 's got some brilliant views , and the wifi is surprisingly good . Even countless miles away from the Earth , I can crush Silver noobs on CS GO . <newline> <newline> I pass by Dale Malkowitz , the head scientist on board . <newline> <newline> `` Evening , Dale , '' I say . <newline> <newline> `` What up , Danny ? '' he replies cordially . <newline> <newline> `` Nothin ' much . A little bored , I guess . '' <newline> <newline> He shakes his head in disbelief . `` I really , *really* do n't understand how you can be bored in space . '' <newline> <newline> `` Well hey , '' I say slightly defensively , `` Aside from the views , it 's kinda ... dull . And empty . And stuff . '' <newline> <newline> `` Whatever you say , Wittell , '' he says , not unkindly . Then he walks off . A few moments pass , and then I decide to look out the window right by me . As my eyes scan the inky blackness of space ( again ) , I notice something odd about the moon 's surface . It 's slightly ... cracked . <newline> <newline> `` Hey , Malkowitz ? '' I call out , `` You might wan na check this out ! '' <newline> <newline> He walks over to me casually , probably expecting nothing . `` What ? '' he asks , `` What do you see ? '' <newline> <newline> I point at the moon . His brow furrows . `` Huh ... I guess there 's something up with the surface . I 'll have to look into tha- '' <newline> <newline> Suddenly , the surface cracks a little more . We glance at each other , and then back at the moon , and then at each other again , and then back at the moon again . <newline> <newline> `` What 's going on ? '' I ask , alarmed . <newline> <newline> He 's silent for a minute or two , mouth hanging open . Then , he calls out : `` Janice ! Terry ! Johnny ! Get over here ! Something 's up with the moon . '' <newline> <newline> The other crewmates enter , unsure of what to expect . As their eyes lay upon the moon 's surface cracks , they widen . <newline> <newline> And , by coincidence , more cracks appear at that very moment . And then more . And more . And more . And more ... <newline> <newline> Little bits of the moon begin to float away , torn free of the rest of the surface . We all stare , speechless . And then ... it happens . It *happens* . <newline> <newline> The side of the moon facing us is ... torn away by a ... <newline> <newline> Human ... hand ? <newline> <newline> And we see ... <newline> <newline> A giant ... human face ? ! <newline> <newline> Surprisingly , I can hear my thoughts over my racing heart . *I ca n't help but feel as if I recognize that face ... from the ... * <newline> <newline> *Internet . * <newline> <newline> Suddenly , the great face 's lips move . <newline> <newline> Of course , none of us can actually *hear* it speak , because of the laws of space and whatnot . However , I can read its lips , and it appears to be saying : <newline> <newline> `` Are you sure about that ? ''\""
