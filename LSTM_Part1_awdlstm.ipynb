However, there are several common methods that can be used to evaluate the quality of the generated text.\n","\n","1. __Human evaluation:__ One of the most reliable methods for evaluating text generation is through human evaluation. This involves having human evaluators read the generated text and rate its quality based on various metrics such as coherence, fluency, and relevance to the prompt or topic. This method provides a subjective evaluation of the text and can give insights into how well the generated text matches human writing.\n","\n","2. __Automated metrics:__ Automated metrics can be used to evaluate text generation based on various quantitative measures. Examples of automated metrics include perplexity, BLEU score, and ROUGE score. These metrics compare the generated text to a reference text or corpus, and provide a measure of the similarity between the two texts.\n","\n","3. __Domain-specific metrics:__ For text generation tasks that are focused on a specific domain, such as medical or legal writing, domain-specific metrics can be used to evaluate the quality of the generated text. These metrics are designed to measure the accuracy and completeness of the generated text within the specific domain.\n","\n","4. __User testing:__ In some cases, user testing can be used to evaluate the quality of the generated text. This involves having users interact with the generated text and providing feedback on its quality, usefulness, and relevance to the task or topic."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4b7e98a2","metadata":{"id":"4b7e98a2"},"source":["__Perplexity__"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"736d838d","metadata":{"id":"736d838d","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":17},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681682291075,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":91121,"user":{"displayName":"mango jain","userId":"08538486604454803686"}},"outputId":"c861aa21-924f-42e4-89dd-e21b780e8575"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","<style>\n","    /* Turns off some styling */\n","    progress {\n","        /* gets rid of default border in Firefox and Opera. */\n","        border: none;\n","        /* Needs to be in here for Safari polyfill so background images work as expected. */\n","        background-size: auto;\n","    }\n","    progress:not([value]), progress:not([value])::-webkit-progress-bar {\n","        background: repeating-linear-gradient(45deg, #7e7e7e, #7e7e7e 10px, #5c5c5c 10px, #5c5c5c 20px);\n","    }\n","    .progress-bar-interrupted, .progress-bar-interrupted::-webkit-progress-bar {\n","        background: #F44336;\n","    }\n","</style>\n"]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":[]},"metadata":{}}],"source":["valid_perplexity = learn.validate()[2]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"b38449fe","metadata":{"id":"b38449fe","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681682291076,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"mango jain","userId":"08538486604454803686"}},"outputId":"33d49d75-0646-43df-94eb-07ff26a62a1a"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["25.749881744384766"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":28}],"source":["valid_perplexity"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.12"},"colab":{"provenance":[],"machine_shape":"hm"},"gpuClass":"premium","accelerator":"GPU"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
